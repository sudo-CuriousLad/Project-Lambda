- # Overview
- **Project Lambda** is a Minecraft series, with the end goal of creating an ultimate futuristic build, with the help of Modded MC.
- The structure of  the series will be similar to Ghost's *Evolving World* Pack, where a new mod(s) is added to the pack. An already-established pack could also be used in place, to improve the fun of the series for *me.*
- Other projects codenamed with Greek letters are planned, each with a different color assigned. Project Lambda will be assigned the color purple.
- The color scheme for the build will be purple, black/grey and white.
