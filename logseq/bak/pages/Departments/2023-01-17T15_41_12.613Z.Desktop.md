- The departments of Project Lambda are quite small in number, but they will grow as the Project progresses towards completion.
- The Chemical Synthesis Department is only to be built if the modpack contains Gregtech.
- The paths to and from the different paths should have an angle of strictly multiples of 45 degrees.
- Every department should have a uniform buildstyle, with a symbol for distinguishing it with other departments. Minor changes can be made to the build style to fit the department better.
